# Airbnb Clone README

## Description
This project is an Airbnb clone developed as part of the curriculum at Holberton. The aim of this project is to recreate the core functionality of the Airbnb website, allowing users to search for and book accommodations, as well as hosts to list their properties for rent.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter serves as the primary interface for interacting with the Airbnb clone. It allows users to execute various commands to manage properties, bookings, users, and other aspects of the application.

### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the command `./console.py` to start the command interpreter.

### How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use the following commands:

- `create`: Create a new instance of a class (e.g., `create User`).
- `show`: Display information about a specific instance (e.g., `show User 1234`).
- `update`: Update attributes of an instance (e.g., `update User 1234 name "John Doe"`).
- `destroy`: Delete a specified instance (e.g., `destroy User 1234`).
- `all`: Display all instances of a class or all instances overall.
- `quit` or `EOF`: Exit the command interpreter.

### Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the command interpreter:

- To create a new user: `create User`
- To display information about a specific user: `show User 1234`
- To update the name of a user: `update User 1234 name "John Doe"`
- To delete a user: `destroy User 1234`
- To display all users: `all User`
